    Detect communities in hypergraph using spectral clustering.
    
    This is the main entry point for community detection. It implements
    the complete pipeline: normalized Laplacian computation, spectral
    embedding, and k-means clustering.
    
    Args:
        hypergraph: Input hypergraph
        k: Number of communities to detect
        weights: Optional edge weights (m-dimensional array)
        random_state: Random seed for reproducibility
        n_init: Number of k-means initializations
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping node_id -> community_id (0 to k-1)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If k is invalid or hypergraph is empty
